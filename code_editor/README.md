## Code Editor
Here I am talking about this project it is basically a simple web code editor here you write HTML, CSS and javascript code and run. 

## How to use
It is very simple to use because everything is in front of you in the HTML section you can write html code and others like CSS and javascript sections and hit the run button to execute the code. There are  other features available you can copy the whole code of a particular language or file save the file and download it. Another feature is lock editors or unlock editors and resize editor size vertically only.  I hope you will enjoy this code editor.
